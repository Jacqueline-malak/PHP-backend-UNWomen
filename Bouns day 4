*********Differences Between Echo and Print in PHP
Echo and Print commands in PHP are language constructs, with the difference that echo is used to output one or more strings, while print is used to output a single string.
Echo doesnâ€™t have a return value, but the print command returns 1, indicating successful execution.
Print command in PHP can accept only one argument. In contrast, echo can accept multiple parameters.
Print command is technically a function but used as a language construct, whereas echo is a language construct.
